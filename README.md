This repository is about Reproducible Research in Data Science using R. The data used in this project is about storm and other weather events that can cause both public

The aim of this project is to analyze this data and answer questions such as what types of events (tornadoes, hurricane, blizzards, etc)
are most harmful to human's health and what types of eventshave the greatest impact on economy?
